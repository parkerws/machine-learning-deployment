# machine-learning-deployment

This project is an exercise I completed to practice the full machine learning model building process. 

In this project:
1. Import of mpg dataset
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Data cleaning/feature engineering
4. Machine learning model comparison/hyperparameter tuning
5. Deployment to Heroku via Flask application
